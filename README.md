the "Back End" of your on-line database project

Part 1 - A description of your Online Database Application
Part 2 - Database Tables and Queries in MySQL
Note: This is the first of two assignments comprising a database application using MySQL (for the back-end) and PHP (for the front-end).

Part 1 - A description of your Online Database Application

Based on our discussion in class, write up a brief report on the system that you wish to prototype for this project.

Ideas and considerations about the application itself and how you want it to appear and to work are listed here on the class notes page on functional concerns and specifications (Class notes on specifications)
Write up your plans as to how you would see this database application implemented from a technical standpoint; some ideas and questions are listed here on the class notes pages about technical specifications.
Part 2 - Database Tables and Queries in MySQL

Write three SQL script file(s) ( .sql files) as follows for your database:

a script to create all of the tables for controlled vocabularies ("reference tables") that you will need along with the INSERT queries required to populate those tables
a script to create all of the tables that will be used with user data entry and/or imported data files
a script to populate the second set of tables with test data (a dozen records or so per table would likely suffice for testing purposes) and/or a script that imports data from text files
Your database should include a minimum of five tables and at least two tables should include a minimum of eight fields, unless you have spoken or corresponded with me individually about your topic.
