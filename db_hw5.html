The idea behind this database is provide the user with an interface to quickly reference Pokemon cards by artist, year, Pokemon name, price and other attributes. I am bringing together bulbapedia.com, PSA.com, and Ebay.com. Far to often, Graded Pokemon cards on eBay are overpriced and buyers are convinced of the cards worth because they have no reference. To get some sort of official base pricing out there would be greatly beneficial to collectors and sellers. This database will be specifically targeting the years between 1995-1999 because that’s where the bulk of my knowledge for pricing Pokemon PSA graded cards is.  Users will not be entering anything into this database. The database will be predefined and the user will have the capability of searching through the database for a specific Pokemon card they need info on. The output of this program will be in the form of filtered searches displayed on web pages. Although the database is predefined the user output will be dynamic. In short, a static back-end and a dynamic front-end.  The file sizes downloaded from this database will be relatively small and should be portable on a laptop.  There are no special calculations required of this database other than summing up and showing the prices of cards. Data validation will happen on the fly when users are inputting what they are searching for. This program shouldn’t require a lengthy security setup considering it is only Pokemon and not some serious banking database. User authentication will not be necessary for this program. The only data this program will be dealing with is text.  The software requirements to run this program will consist of MySQL, PHP, and possibly python for cleaning up data were necessary. As far as disk space is concerned the prototype should not take up too much space and the same goes for a large-scale approach to this database. I would like this project to be accessible to desktop, tablet, and mobile users. The backing up of data for this system should only need to be done once and the updating of the system on a daily basis should not be necessary considering I am only using card artworks from a determined period, 1995-1999.
